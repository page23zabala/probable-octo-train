  <h2>Port Barton</h2>
  <p>
    Port Barton is just a small village along the western coast of northern Palawan. Contrary to popular belief, it is NOT a town. It is simply one of the barangays of the municipality of San Vicente. The confusion probably stems from the fact that when locals say “San Vicente,” they usually refer to the town proper (near Long Beach). Because Port Barton is 3 hours away from the poblacion (town proper) by land, it is always mistaken as a separate municipality.

    The Tubbataha Reef Marine Park covers 96,828 ha, including the North and South Atolls and the Jessie Beazley Reef.

  <h2>Coron Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    Coron is best known for world-class World War II-era wreck diving, the island also offers limestone karst landscapes, beautiful beaches, crystal-clear freshwater lakes, and shallow-water coral reefs.
	Coron is a separate group of islands from the main Palawan island. All of the islands here are part of the Calamian Archipelago in Northern Palawan. Often compared to El Nido, a popular Palawan destination, Coron has a unique charm of its own.
